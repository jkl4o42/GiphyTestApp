# GiphyTestApp

## Technologies Utilized:
- Kotlin
- MVVM Architectural Pattern
- Hilt (Dependency Injection)
- Retrofit (Networking)
- Coroutines (Asynchronous Programming)
- [Giphy API for fetching GIFs](https://developers.giphy.com)

## Application Overview:
The GiphyTestApp comprises two primary screens:

1. **GIF List Screen**:
   - Displays a list of GIFs fetched from Giphy API.
   - Features a text field with auto-complete functionality to facilitate user search for GIFs.

2. **Full-Screen GIF Display Screen**:
   - Enlarges and displays the selected GIF in full-screen mode for a better viewing experience.

## Known Issue:
In the `GiphyListViewModel.Base.searchGifs()` method, a bug is documented within the code that is yet to be resolved. Any insights or solutions to address this issue would be greatly appreciated.
